# Lead Scoring Model - X Education

## Project Overview
This project implements a lead scoring system for X Education, an online education company, to optimize their lead conversion process. Using logistic regression, we've developed a model that assigns a score from 0 to 100 to each potential lead, enabling more efficient targeting of prospective students.

## Business Problem
X Education aims to improve their lead conversion rate by identifying the most promising potential customers (leads) among professionals seeking to enroll in their courses. The challenge is to build a model that can effectively prioritize leads based on their likelihood to convert into paying customers.

## Solution
We've developed a logistic regression model that:
- Analyzes various lead characteristics and behaviors
- Assigns a lead score between 0 and 100
- Helps the sales team prioritize their outreach efforts
- Increases the efficiency of the lead conversion process

## Key Features
- Lead scoring based on multiple parameters
- Probability-based scoring system (0-100)
- Data-driven insights for sales team
- Focused targeting of high-potential leads
